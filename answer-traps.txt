1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

a0 a1 a2
line:
  2c:	4635                	li	a2,13

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

inline and calculate already in line:
  2e:	45b1                	li	a1,12

3. At what address is the function printf located?

73e
in main:
```
  38:	706000ef          	jal	73e <printf>
```
in definition of printf:

```asm
void
printf(const char *fmt, ...)
{
 73e:	711d                	addi	sp,sp,-96
...
```

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

jal: jump and link

'jal imm' would do 2 operations:
  (1) Store the next addr (e.g. just next to 'jal xx') to reg ra (return address).
  (2) Jump to the addr specified in imm.


```asm
  38:	706000ef          	jal	73e <printf>
  exit(0);
  3c:	4501                	li	a0,0
```
so ra = 0x3c

5. Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, (char *) &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

Here's a description of little- and big-endian and a more whimsical description.

```
HE110 World
```

dec: 57616
dex: E110

M (MSB, Most Significant Byte)
$I_1$
$I_2$
L (LSB, Least Significant Byte)

0x00646c72
M        I1       I2       L
00000000 01100100 01101100 01110010
b7    b0 b7    b0 b7    b0 b7    b0
\0       d        l        r

r = 72
l = 6c
d = 64


If big end:

i = 01001110001101100010011000000000
  = 4E362600

57616 no need to change

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

user/call.c:18:19: error: format '%d' expects a matching 'int' argument [-Werror=format=]
   18 |   printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
      |                  ~^
      |                   |
      |                   int

kinda UB, gcc avoid it. While if not checked by compiler, it would be the int in a2 register, which is junk
